# Discerning differences: A study on lexical features and vectorization techniques
## Introduction
With the implementation of ChatGPT and its rising popularity, text generation and processing have taken the forefront of AI. Due to its ability to produce human-like responses, and its ability to produce other forms of media, concerns regarding its misuse have also risen. With the growth of natural language generation models (NLG), AI detection software must also stay relevant to prevent the potential threats of misuse of NLG text. Detecting and discerning between human and synthetic text is pivotal for maintaining authenticity and security in digital communication. Current AI text content detectors are becoming obsolete with each new iteration of GPT. Focus must begin shifting onto our text detection tools rather than the NLG models, as to prevent data misuse. So in this project, we tackle the text detection methods within the paper “ChatGPT Generated Text Detection” (Shijaku & Canhasi, 2023) to test the validity of their methods, and expand upon their experimentations.
